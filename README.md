# ReadMe for File Icons Black Theme


# Introduction
I created Icons for files with special endings for example .bat, .html or .css. Fell free to download and use them.

But please donÂ´t say that they are yours!

# Getting started
To use those Icons you first have to download them. Then you have to download an extra software to change the default Icons of these file endings. I have used the "Default Programs Editor" which is a standalone app (https://defaultprogramseditor.com). Then you have to open the .zip. After that you go to "File Type Settings" and then to "Icon" . Then you can search or type in the file typ you want to change. For example you want to change the .bat file Icon you type in ".bat" and doubleclick on the entry. After that you click on "Browse" and search the file you want to add as new default Icon. After you found it you click on "Save Icon". Now its done.

If there are some file endings you think I forgot, feel free to write a comment with the things you want.
