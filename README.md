# ReadMe for File Icons Black Theme

I created Icons for files with special endings for example .bat, .html or .css. Fell free to download and use them.

## Getting started
To use those Icons you have to download them. Then you have to download an extra software to change the default Icons of these file endings. I used the `Default Programs Editor` which is a standalone app (https://defaultprogramseditor.com). Then you have to open the .zip. After that you go to `File Type Settings` and then to `Icon` . Then you can search or type in the file typ you want to change. For example you want to change the .bat file Icon you type in `.bat` and doubleclick on the entry. After that you click on `Browse` and search the file you want to add as new default Icon. After you found it you click on `Save Icon`. Now its done. You can repeat that procedure to change all other Icons.

If there are some file endings you think I forgot, feel free to write a comment with the things you want.
